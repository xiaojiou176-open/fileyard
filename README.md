fileorganize is a local-first file organizer. Drop a messy folder. Get a manifest, a plan, and a one-click apply. Your originals never move until you say so.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LOCAL-FIRST          ████████ 100%  │
│  SOURCE-TRACEABLE     ████████ 100%  │
│  TYPING REQUIRED      ░░░░░░░░   0%  │
│  VIBES                ████████ ZERO  │

└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> AI-assisted file triage. Manifest-first, never destructive.

## What You Get

| Surface | What |
|---|---|
| `fileorganize cli` | Scan, plan, manifest. Apply only when you nod. |
| `fileorganize webui` | Browse the plan. Approve, edit, or send back for another pass. |
| `fileorganize mcp` | Same engine, exposed as an MCP server for any agent. |
| `contracts & manifest` | Plans are diffable. Plans are reviewable. Plans are receipts. |
| `public skills` | Drop into Claude/Codex/OpenClaw. Hand it a folder. Get a library. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Local-first by default. No silent telemetry. No cloud round-trip. Your data stays on your machine until you explicitly ship it somewhere.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaojiou176-open/fileorganize.git
cd fileorganize
# follow the per-stack quickstart in INSTALL.md or docs/
```

Three commands. No `curl | sh`. No login. Read what you run.

Install break? Open your favorite agent and say *"Read AGENTS.md and bootstrap fileorganize for me."* Agent fix own brain. Long version: [`docs/`](./docs/).

## How It Work

The repo is seven layers — exactly the seven commits in `git log`. New work goes in as small named PRs. No 50-file mystery commits.

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| `chore: scaffold` | License, governance, hygiene gates, CI scaffolding. |
| `feat(core)` | The primary engine. The reason fileorganize exists. |
| `feat(modules)` | Packages, adapters, services, plugins. The second floor. |
| `feat(contracts)` | Schemas, configs, public boundaries. Other code talks here. |
| `test:` | Receipts. Everything in this layer must run. |
| `feat(ops)` | Scripts, infra, CI helpers, build glue. |
| `docs:` | Public docs surface. The pretty face. |

`git log` reads like a building floor plan. Look once, know the whole shape.
